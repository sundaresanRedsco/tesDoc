The need for a report is determined by the specific goals, requirements, or circumstances of a particular enterprise. Reports serve as a valuable tool for effective communication, decision-making, documentation, and accountability in a wide range of professional settings.

Reports Interface is used to regenerate and monitor the API matrix system performance, which is synchronized with the project API and its member activity.

The reports interface has two tabs, such as Overview and Charts.

## Overview

From the side menu bar, on clicking the reports menu option, it will be redirected to the reports overview screen.

You can view all your project API performance, its service call status, and its error codes.
The user can check the API call requested date, status code, method of the API, and NXT API matrix API name.

From the left bar, on clicking Workspsace and its project name in the overview tabs, the project-related collections and operation values will get auto-loaded in the drop-down menu, where users can choose to inspect the report and also enable users to use the calendar search to check the report for the desired period on clicking the Apply button.

**Click Worksapce -->Project --> Select Collection name --> Select Operations name --> Select Date --> Click Apply button**

Note: If the project does not have collection or operation, it will show empty, and the table display will show no records found.
