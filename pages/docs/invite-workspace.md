# Invite Members to Workspace

      Inviting members to a workspace in the NXT API Matrix is a common operation that enables team collaboration and workspace management. During this process, only authorised users with work email addresses can be invited. Here are the step-by-step instructions for inviting new members to the workspace.

       - Enter the email address of the member to whom the workspace invite has to be sent.

       - An invitation can be sent to more than one recipient, which is separated by ','.

       - The access level for the recipients will be determined by the roles selected from the dropdown, which can be either 'Member' or 'Admin.' After selecting a role, click the 'Send Invite' button, and the invite link will be shared with the specified work emails. Additionally, you can easily share the workspace invite link with the team or members by using the 'Copy Invite Link' function, accessible with a single click

By entering valid information on the registration screen and clicking the 'Sign Up' button, the member will successfully register with the NXT API Matrix. The user will receive an account activation link at the registered work email address.
