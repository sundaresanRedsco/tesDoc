# {% $markdoc.frontmatter.title %}

NXT API Matrix offers the concept of workspaces to help users organise and manage their API-related projects, environments, and configurations.

Workspaces can be created in three different ways within the NXT API Matrix.

Step 1: From the homepage, click on the create workspace button.
Step 2: From the homepage, select the Create workspace button from the Workspaces dropdown in the top menu bar.

     - Step 3: From the side menu bar, select the workspace menu. This will navigate you to the workspace screen. Click on the **+** symbol to **Create a Workspace**.

- Let us see how to create a workspace using the following image:

- Users have the option to create a new workspace for their project. When creating a workspace, they need to fill in the following fields: Name* (Textbox, 30-character limit), Summary* (Description box, 300-character limit), and Permission* (Radio button - Personal or Team). Upon filling these fields and clicking the **Create Workspace** button, a new workspace will be created.

In Permission field has two following fields: Team and Personal

- Team: All users, including owners, admins, and members, have the ability to invite other users to join their respective workspaces as either Admin or Member users.

- Personal: The user who creates a workspace with personal permission settings is the only one who can access that specific workspace. They won't be able to invite members.

As an Admin user, the workspace is visible on the homepage, but access to inviting members is restricted. Meanwhile, as a Member user, the workspace is not visible on their account page.

If a user attempts to create a workspace with a name that already exists, an error will be displayed: 

**Workspace name is already used. Please use different name**.

By creating the workspace with the Personal option, you can only access the workspace, which will not be shared with other users or members.
By creating the workspace with the team option, you can invite other users or members.





Such created workspaces will be highlighted on the Homepage under the **Recently Visited workspaces** and **Recent activities** also in the **Side Menu Workspace menu** same item will be displayed for access.

- Example: Let's assume **BANK1** is the workspace created. Select the **BANK1** under the **Recently Visited Workspaces** or **Recent Activities**, both of which lead to the respective workspace screen where you can add projects and utilise the add-on features.

- The list of created workspaces can also be viewed by selecting the **Workspace** from the **Side Menubar**
   
Inviting members to the workspace access.

- The activity log is used to view the workspaces created by users. Additionally, it allows users to see members who have accepted invitations and members who were invited by the owner, admin, or members, along with information on who invited them and the corresponding time and date. The workspace can also be filtered using specific dates after clicking the ``Apply`` button.

### Delete Workspace
Users can delete a created project. When a specific project name is clicked in a tree view, the existing project list will be displayed. When hovering over a row with the operation name, a delete icon will appear.

On click of the delete icon, it will display the delete confirmation popup. On click of the Yes button, the operation will be permanently removed.

In the Search tab of the NXT API Matrix, you can search for specific workspaces and projects, and the results will be filtered in the Recently Visited Workspaces and Recent Activities sections.


The header bar includes tabs for Home, Workspace, and Reports. These tabs provide quick access to key sections within the NXT API Matrix platform, allowing you to navigate seamlessly to your desired destination.
