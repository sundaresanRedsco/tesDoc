A project serves a particular purpose or addresses a specific need and is to be created in the workspace.

Multiple projects can be created under one workspace, and each project is a standalone application that is not interconnected.

- Projects can be created in two different ways in the NXT API Matrix.

- Step 1: Select the **Workspace** name under the **Recently Visited Workspaces** or **Recent Activities section**. When you click on the workspace name, it will redirect you to the workspace screen, where you can create a project.

  - Users can create a new project by clicking the **+** symbol or selecting **Create Project** from the **Workspace** dropdown in the top menu bar.

Let us see how to create a project  through the following image:

  Users have the option to create a new project under the workspace. Creating a project involves filling in fields like Name* (Textbox, 30-character limit), Summary* (Description box, 300-character limit), and Permission* (Radio button - Personal or Team). Once these fields are filled out, clicking the 'Create Project' button will create the new project.

  In Permission field has two following fields: Team and Personal

- Team: All users, including owners, admins, and members, have the ability to invite other users to join their respective workspaces as either Admin or Member users.

- Personal: The user who creates a project with personal permission settings is the only one who can access that specific workspace. They won't be able to invite members.

 As an Admin user, the project is visible on the homepage, but access to inviting members is restricted. Meanwhile, as a Member user, the project is not visible on their account page.

  If a user attempts to create a project with a name that already exists, an error will be displayed: 

**Project name is already used. Please use different name**.

  Creating a project with the 'Personal' option means that it can only be accessed by you and won't be shared with other users or members. On the other hand, creating a project with the 'Team' option allows you to invite other users or members to collaborate.

  

Projects created this way will be highlighted on the homepage under **Recently Visited Workspaces** and **Recent Activities**.  They will also appear in the **Sidebar Menu** under the workspace's name. By clicking the **+** symbol before the workspace name, a list of project names will be displayed. Clicking on a project name will redirect you to the project overview screen.

The activity log is used to view the workspaces created by users. Additionally, it allows users to see members who have accepted invitations and members who were invited by the owner, admin, or members, along with information on who invited them and the corresponding time and date. The workspace can also be filtered using specific dates after clicking the ``Apply`` button.
