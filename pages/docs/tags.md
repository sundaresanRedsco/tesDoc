A project serves a particular purpose or addresses a specific need and is to be created in the workspace.

Multiple projects can be created under one workspace, and each project is a standalone application that is not interconnected.

- Projects can be created in two different ways in the NXT API Matrix.

- Step 1: Select the **Workspace** name under the **Recently Visited Workspaces** or **Recent Activities section**. When you click on the workspace name, it will redirect you to the workspace screen, where you can create a project.

  - Users can create a new project by clicking the **+** symbol or selecting **Create Project** from the **Workspace** dropdown in the top menu bar.

Let us see how to create a project  through the following image:

  Users have the option to create a new project under the workspace. Creating a project involves filling in fields like Name (a text box), Summary (a description box), and Permission (radio buttons for Personal or Team). Once these fields are filled out, clicking the 'Create Project' button will create the new project.

  Creating a project with the 'Personal' option means that it can only be accessed by you and won't be shared with other users or members. On the other hand, creating a project with the 'Team' option allows you to invite other users or members to collaborate.

  

Projects created this way will be highlighted on the homepage under **Recently Visited Workspaces** and **Recent Activities**.  They will also appear in the **Sidebar Menu** under the workspace's name. By clicking the **+** symbol before the workspace name, a list of project names will be displayed. Clicking on a project name will redirect you to the project overview screen.
