# Invite Members to Project

      Inviting members to a project in an NXT API matrix is a common operation that allows for team collaboration in order to operate and manage the project. During the process of inviting new members to the project, only users with authorized work email addresses are invited.

    -  Enter the email address of the member to whom the project invite has to be sent.

    - An invitation can be sent to more than one recipient, which is separated by ','.

    - The access level for recipients will be determined by the roles selected from the drop-down menu, either 'Member' or 'Admin.' Clicking the 'Send Invite' button will share the invite link with the work emails. Additionally, you can quickly share the workspace invite link with the team or members using the 'Copy Invite Link' function with a single click.
